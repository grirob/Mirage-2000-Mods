Weapons added: 

AGM-84D (Not really functional)
  - Is supposed to impact at selected steerpoint, falls short by quite a distance.

MICA IR/RF 
  - Both must be launched as a FOX1
  - However MICA IR appears to function like a FOX2
  - MICA RF seems to function as a FOX3. 
  - Neither seem to have very accurate range/tracking behaviour.

2000lb JDAM
  - If launched within range, will impact at selected steerpoint. 


Spanish Br.250 GP Bombs from F1


R73 AAM 
  - Same as MICA IR


Litening TGP 
  - Nonfunctional


HARM 
  - Works a bit like a Shrike (Homes on closest radar source)
